                    <h2>REGINE BISTO</h2>
                    <p>I'm Regine Goden Bisto. I am 26 years old from Matalom Leyte. And currently lives in Tunasan Muntinlupa City. My mother was Hermenia Goden and Rico Bisto Sr. my father. My mother works as a housemaid and my father is a driver. We were six siblings and I was the eldest. My mom and dad have been apart for a long time.But it’s okay lang naman hehe… <br>At Matalom National High School I graduated my High School. I didn’t get to College right away because we didn’t have money. So I first worked as a housemaid in our province. I also thought of leaving my province to work here in Manila. So I worked as a maid for five years. Year 2015 I met a family who helped me get an education. They helped me with everything. Even my stay in their house is free and I don't spend anything on my education even though I don't need to ask my parents for money. And I'am super blessed because I met them. Today I am studying at the Lyceum of Alabang a private school that I never thought I would be able to enter or study. I am a third year college now. And hopefully I will be able to finish my studies. So that I can reciprocate what they have helped me with. And I can help my mom too.
                        That’s all. Thankyou :)
